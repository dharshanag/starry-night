# Turtle => starry-night
 - I have made a program where the turtle draws stars randomly on the screen
 - all the stars are different in shape, size and color
 - I made this program with the help of the book Coding Projects in Python, a book by DK :https://www.amazon.com/Coding-Projects-Python-DK/dp/1465461884
 - If you would like to add or change anything in this program, it would be great if you could tell me what you changed.
